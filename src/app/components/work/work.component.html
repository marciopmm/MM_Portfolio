            It shows the position on the map (Google Maps) and, when user phisically visit the working site, he give a status update to the job.
            The register was made offline and then, when mobile network or WiFi was available, it could update a central API.<br/>
            It was made using Ionic and SQLite (App), and NodeJS with MongoDB (API). I don't have the accurate numbers, but I heard of a group of users that was about 40% less effort on keep constructions updated after a visit.

            This project made a bridge between an automated industrial machine and an Android Tablet.

            It was made using Xamarin Android (C#). The company did not provides the numbers, but this software is the flagship of the business.

          <h4>FCamara (2011 to 2015)</h4>
          <p class="project">
            <em>Client: <strong>Unimed FESP</strong></em><br/>
            <em>Project: <strong>Chronic Patients Management</strong></em><br/>
            This project was a legacy one. It was made to make easy to a nurse to schedule and update a call to a chronic patient. But the system grown up in size, and the code was not made to scale up.
            So my mission was to reduce the service time for a user, that was about 20 minutes, by 50%.
            Then I made a thorough analysis: on the client side, the script loads to much data, and on the server side, the queries retrieves too much data for the client to process.<br/>
            After almost 3 months of effort, I made an extreme makeover on the Javascript code, and reformulate all the SQL queries with stored procedures.<br/>
            I used pure HTML and Javascript with jQuery and Prototype frameworks, and C# to make the API. The goal is achieved: the service time dropped from 20 to 4 minutes, a gain of 80%.

            This project is a product for Laywers that subscribing AASP service. They receive, daily, an email that contains all citations to their names or registry codes into any process containing in the Official Diary.
            There are lots of Official Diaries in Brazil, and they also have differents formats as well. My mission was to find a Regular Expression that could match the notice in the respectively Diary, if not all, clip this notice and send it to the Lawyer by email.<br/>
            I used C# in this entire project, and made a growing up from 32 to 68 journals in about 1 year working in this project.
