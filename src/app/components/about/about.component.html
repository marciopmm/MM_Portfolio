            I was born and raised in the city of SÃ£o Paulo, in Brazil. ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡·<br/>
            I started my studies in programming languages at the age of 13 with BASIC and COBOL. Started working at 14 (1990), and since then I love computer related matters.

          <p>
            In 2001, I started my Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science. 8 years later my graduation, in 2012, I started a Master's Degree in Software Enginering, finishing it at 2014.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 2020, at age of 44, I had to submit myself to a heart surgery, and in the middle of it I got complications, resulting in a stroke. For consequence, I lost the capability of speak.<br/>
            But now I'm really better. I got to re-learn Portuguese and now it's time to practice English speaking.
          </p>
          <p>In 2022 I started my Online Masters Degree in Data Analysis, finishing at 2023.</p>
          <p>In 2023 I started my Online Masters Degree in Data Science, and I'm close to finish it.</p>
          <p>Also in 2023 I came to live in Lisbon with my wife. We've been already here at vacation, and we simply love this country. ðŸ‡µðŸ‡¹</p>
          <p>
            I'm a hobbist pianist, and a singer too.
            I'm also a Poker Player, and got a Podcast in Portuguese about this fabolous game.
            I love music, and that is my second formation and my third passion.<br/>
            My job with computers are my second one. My family is the first. I have a beautiful wife, grown up son and daughter, and one lovely granddaughter.
